# 🚀 Day 05: C++ OOP Mastery — Inheritance and Virtual Functions

Welcome to **Day 05** of my **C++ OOP Mastery** journey. This repository contains hands-on practice and implementation of core **Object-Oriented Programming** concepts in C++, focusing on:

- ✅ Access Specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)
- ✅ Inheritance Types (Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical)
- ✅ Virtual Functions & Function Overriding
- ✅ Real-world examples using `Shape → Rectangle, Circle` and `Person → Student, Teacher`

## 🔍 Concepts Covered

### 1. **Access Specifiers**
Demonstrates how class members behave with `public`, `private`, and `protected` access.

### 2. **Inheritance**
- **Public Inheritance:** Retains access level from base class.
- **Protected/Private Inheritance:** Modifies access to inherited members.
- Includes examples of **base → derived → multilevel** hierarchies.

### 3. **Virtual Functions**
- Polymorphism using `virtual` keyword.
- Runtime behavior overriding using `Shape → Rectangle, Circle`.
- `Person → Student, Teacher` shows practical function overriding.
